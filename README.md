## App Brainstorming

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
Example App: Instagram
Changing the background color of the messages screen
Deleting old messages
Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features
you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

An app I would Like to buld is a game. You strat with a ball on the screen and you tilt your phione to move the ball and try to touch a point on the screen before 
the timer runs out. Everytime you touch the pint the timer will increase in some seconds. You can start with different dificulties. You can also change the color 
of the backround, the ball, and the point. A feature I would add is that you can play with your friends in real time and see who can last the longest.
